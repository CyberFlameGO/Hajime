If you'd like to contribute, submit a pull request. New features would be great. There are only a few rules:

1. All code must be in shell script or C++.
2. All code must be header-only; this means you don't need Make.
3. Code should make use of existing function for output and logging. For example, try to use the Output class to make things simpler.
